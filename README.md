# 🌐 Web Development Projects

This repository serves as the **master index (hub)** for all my **Web Development work**. Instead of cluttering GitHub with dozens of small repositories, the projects are **logically grouped** into dedicated frontend and backend repositories, and this repo connects everything in one clean place.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Give a **clear, high‑level map** of my complete web development journey—frontend to backend—without noise.

---

## 🧭 Repository Architecture

All web development work is divided into **two core repositories**, based on technology and domains:

### 🔹 1. Frontend Web Development Projects

👉 **Focus:** UI, UX, interactivity, and client-side logic

Includes:

* HTML & CSS projects
* HTML & CSS projects using frameworks/libraries
* HTML, CSS & JavaScript projects
* React projects

🔗 **Frontend Repository:**

---

### 🔹 2. Backend Web Development Projects

👉 **Focus:** APIs, server-side logic, databases, and authentication

Includes:

* Basic APIs (learning & experimentation)
* REST APIs
* Django projects
* Django REST Framework APIs

🔗 **Backend Repository:**
➡️ *Link will be added here*
